# TWOC2DTileMapEditor
A simple 2D tile based map editor.

It is able to read and write XML based map files with layers, per tile collision, and other custom properties per tile.

Put the sample tileset fts1.png into the same directory as your exe. Then you can load one of the sample maps in the TestFiles directory. 

Interface flow needs work, but it's generally functional.
