The last IDE I used to work on this was Microsoft's Visual Studio 2019 community edition with C# and WinForms, so you will need that IDE or newer and those features to check it out.

It is able to read and write XML based map files with layers, per tile collision, and other custom properties per tile.

Put the sample tileset fts1.png into the same directory as your exe. Then you can load one of the sample maps in the TestFiles directory. 

Interface flow needs work, but it's generally functional.
